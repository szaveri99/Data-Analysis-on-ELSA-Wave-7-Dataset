# ELSA Wave 7 Dataset - Osteoporosis Prediction with Logistic Regression

This repository presents an analysis of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) Wave 7 dataset, with a focus on predicting osteoporosis using logistic regression. The analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS, a widely used statistical software tool.

## Overview

The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) is a comprehensive and nationally representative study that collects data from a large sample of older individuals in England. Wave 7 is one of the study's data collection waves and contains a wealth of information about health, lifestyle, and well-being of the participants.

Osteoporosis is a common bone condition that primarily affects older adults, leading to fragile bones and an increased risk of fractures. The goal of this analysis is to predict the likelihood of osteoporosis among ELSA Wave 7 participants using logistic regression, a popular statistical technique for binary classification tasks.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Exploration**: The ELSA Wave 7 dataset was explored to understand the available variables, data distributions, and potential predictors of osteoporosis.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to handle missing values, convert variables, and create a dataset suitable for logistic regression.

- **Logistic Regression**: A logistic regression model was developed to predict the likelihood of osteoporosis. Logistic regression is well-suited for binary classification tasks and provides insights into the relationships between predictor variables and the outcome.

- **IBM SPSS**: IBM SPSS was used for data analysis, model creation, and result interpretation. SPSS is known for its user-friendly interface and powerful statistical capabilities.

## Repository Contents

- **Dataset**: The ELSA Wave 7 dataset used for this analysis is included in the repository. The dataset contains various variables related to health, demographics, and lifestyle.

- **SPSS Syntax File**: The SPSS syntax file used for data preprocessing, logistic regression model building, and result analysis is provided.

- **Results and Interpretations**: The results of the logistic regression model, including coefficient values, odds ratios, and model performance statistics, are available for reference.

## Running the Analysis

To replicate this analysis, you need access to IBM SPSS. You can import the provided dataset and the SPSS syntax file into SPSS and execute the script to perform data analysis, logistic regression modeling, and result interpretation. Adjust the analysis as needed and explore the dataset further.

## Results

The primary result of this analysis is the logistic regression model's output, which provides insights into the factors that are associated with an increased or decreased likelihood of osteoporosis among ELSA Wave 7 participants. The model's performance metrics, such as the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and ROC curve, are available to assess the model's accuracy and goodness of fit.
